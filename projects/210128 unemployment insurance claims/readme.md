### Final Project - Unemployment Insurance Claims

For our final project, we analyzed a dataset of unemployment insurance claim rates in New York State from 2003 to the present.

We combined Python data wrangling with Tableau visualization and created presentations in PowerPoint.

The final presentations were presented to CUNY staff. This is the Python work we did to supplement our Tableau visualizations.
